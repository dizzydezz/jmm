# Why upgrade to JMM and MyAnime3 #



This page is intended for users of MyAnime2<br>
It will help you decide whether it worth upgrading from MyAnime2 to JMM/MyAnime3<br>

<h2>Generic Files</h2>

Now when a file does not exist on AniDB, and you manually link it to an episode it will add a generic file on AniDB<br>
This means when you watch that file locally status is maiantained on AniDB<br>

<h2>Multiple Clients</h2>

JMM has a central server component which manages a shared database (and also does all the hashing of files etc).<br>
MyAnime3 and JMM clients connect to this server to get all information. This means that you can run more than one instance of MediaPortal/MyAnime3 without needing to double up on databases or hash files on each instance<br>

<h2>Multiple Users</h2>

You can now create multiple users when starting MyAnime3 / JMM Client or any other client<br>
Each individual user provides the following advantages<br>
- Separate episode watched states<br>
- Separate favorites<br>

<h2>Choice of Database</h2>

You can select MS SQL Server 2008 for greater speed, or stay with sqlite for ease of use and portability<br>
