Guide on the File Manager tab in JMM Desktop



## Introduction ##

The File Manager is where you can handle any file related operations on your underlying collections<br>

<h3>Unrecognized Files</h3>

Also known as un-linked files<br>
During the import, if a file cannot be found on AniDB it will be listed here. This tab will allow you to manually link that file to a series.<br>

If you don't have the series in your collection yet, you can create it using the "New Series" button. You can add it to an existing group or create a new group<br>
After entering the AniDB ID, JMM will then download all the information from AniDB including the episodes<br>

<h4>Linking Files</h4>

You have a number of options when linking files to an episode<br>
If you select one file, you can then select a single episode from the episode drop down list.You can also optionally select an episode range. This is used when you have one file that covers multiple episodes<br>

You can also select multiple files<br>
After doing this you would usually select an episode range. For example, select 20 files and then assign episode 1 - 20<br>
You can also just select one episode. This is needed for episodes that are split across multiple files<br>

<h3>Ignored Files</h3>

IF you don't want to assign a file to an episode in the previous tab, you also have the option of "Ignoring" that file.  This tab simply allows you to reverse that action<br>

<h3>Manually Linked</h3>

Any files that you link on the 'Unrecognized Files' tab will appear here. This screen simply lets you see which files you have linked previously, and un-link them if you want.<br>

<h3>Duplicate Files</h3>

Every now and then you might download a file or series twice, and then possibly store them in different locations. This screen will show you all of those entries, so you can choose how you want to handle them<br>

It is important to note that JMM does not allow more than one of the same exact file in one collection<br>

<h3>Multiple Files</h3>

This screen will show you all the episodes for which you have more than file. This will be the case where you have downloaded the same episode from more than one subbing group, or have downloaded a higher quality version of the same episode<br>

From this screen the idea is to delete any files that you no longer want. However, you may want to keep multiple versions of the same episode, and can ignore this screen<br>
