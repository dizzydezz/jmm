Guide on the Downloads tab in JMM Desktop



## Introduction ##

The Downloads tab helps you to search and browse torrents from multiple sites, and also to add and manage torrents in uTorrent<br>

uTorrent integration allows you to manage your uTorrent downloads even if they are on a different machine<br>

NOTE - current the only torrent client supported is uTorrent.<br>

<h3>Settings</h3>

For uTorrent integration to work you must enable the Web UI in your client. It should look something like the following.<br>
